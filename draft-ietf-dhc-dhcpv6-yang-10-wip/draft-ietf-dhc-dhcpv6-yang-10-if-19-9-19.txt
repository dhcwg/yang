1.  Introduction

   DHCPv6 [RFC8415] is widely used for supplying configuration and other
   relevant parameters to clients in IPv6 networks.  This document
   defines DHCPv6 YANG data modules for the configuration and management
   of DHCPv6 servers, relays and clients.

   [RFC8415] describes the current version of the DHCPv6 base protocol
   specification.  In addition to this, a large number of additon
   specifications have also been published.  These extend DHCPv6 element
   funciontionality and add new options.  The YANG modules contained in
   this document do not attempt to capture all of these extensions and
   additions, rather to model the DHCPv6 functions and options covered
   in [RFC8415].  A focus has also been given on the extensability of

Internet-Draft              DHCPv6 YANG Model             September 2019


   the modules so that it is easy to augment in additional funtionality
   as required by a particular implementation or deployment scenario.

   The modules in this document only attempt to model DHCPv6 specific
   behaviour.  They do not cover the configuration and management of
   specific DHCPv6 element's implementations.  There is too much
   variance between implementations to be attempt to standardize these
   functions in a way that is useful without being restrictive.

   However, it is recognised that implementation specific configuration
   and management is also an essential part of element deployment and
   operations.  To resolve this, the Appendix of this document contains
   an example module for the configuration of implementation specfic
   funtions, illustrating how this functionality can be augemented into
   the main ietf-dhcpv6-server.yang module.

   In DHCPv6 the concept of 'class selection' for messaages received by
   the server is common.  This is the identification of messages based
   on a number of parameters so that messages can be correctly
   identified and classified and the correct provisioning information
   can be supplied.  For example, taking a prefix from the correct pool,
   or supplying a set of options relevant for a specific vendor's client
   implementation.  During the development of this document, research
   has been carried out into a number of vendor's class selection
   implementations and the findings were that while this function is
   common to all, the method for implementing this differs greatly.
   Therefore, this function has been ommitted from the DHCPv6 server
   module.  The appendix provides an example module for the class
   selection function, intended to demonstrate how this is intended to
   integrate with the main ieft-dhcpv6-server.yang module.

   DHCPv6 options vary in their applicablity.  Some are permitted only
   to be sent by either the server, relay, or client.  Some may be sent
   by more than one of these elements.  In order to avoid duplication of
   the option definitions, a single module containing all of the
   [RFC8415] options is defined here.  YANG identities are then used to
   define the applicability of each option for the relevant DHCPv6
   element(s).

   A large number of DHCPv6 options have been created in addition to
   those defined in [RFC8415].  As implementations differ in which
   specific DHCPv6 options that they support, the following approach has
   been taken to defining options: The set of DHCPv6 options defined in
   [RFC8415] are included in this document.  Further options can be
   added in new YANG modules via augmentation.  The Appendixes provide
   an example of how this can be done.

   It is worth noting that as DHCPv6 is itself a client configuration
   protocol, it is not the intention of this document to replace the
   allocation of DHCPv6 assigned addressing and parameters using
   NETCONF/YANG.  The DHCPv6 client model is intended for the
   configuration of the DHCPv6 client function and also for obtaining
   DHCPv6 provisioned read-only state data from the client, learned via
   the normal DHCPv6 message flow.  This gives the network operator
   better management and troubleshooting capabilities.

1.1.  Terminology

   The reader should be familiar with the YANG data modelling language
   defined in [RFC7950].

   The YANG modules in this document adopt the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  The meanings of the symbols
   used in tree diagrams are defined in [RFC8340].

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in DHCPv6
   [RFC8415] and other relevant documents.

   The DHCPv6 tree diagrams provide a concise representation of a YANG
   module to help the reader understand the module structure.

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is provided
   in this document.  For a description of the symbols in these
   diagrams, please refer to [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

                   Figure 1: DHCPv6 Data Model Structure

   Introduction of important nodes:

   o  server-config: This container contains the configuration data of a
      server.

   o  serv-attributes: This container contains basic attributes of a
      DHCPv6 server such as DUID, server name and so on.  Some optional
      functions that can be provided by the server is also included.

Internet-Draft              DHCPv6 YANG Model             September 2019


   o  duid: Each server and client has only one DUID (DHCP Unique
      Identifier).  The DUID here identifies a unique DHCPv6 server for
      clients.  DUID consists of a two-octet type field and an arbitrary
      length (no more than 128 bytes) content field.  Currently there
      are four defined types of DUIDs in [RFC8415] and [RFC6355] - DUID-
      LLT, DUID-EN, DUID-LL and DUID-UUID.  DUID-Unknown represents
      those unconventional DUIDs.

   o  lease-storage: The server can store lease data in different
      repositories, whether in a CSV file for smaller deployments or in
      a database for larger deployments.

   o  operator-option-ipv6-address, operator-option-single-flag,
      operator-option-ipv6-prefix, operator-option-int32, operator-
      option-int16, operator-option-int8, operator-option-uri, operator-
      option-textstring, operator-option-var-data, operator-option-dns-
      wire: are generic option formats described in [RFC7227].

   o  interfaces-config: A leaf list to denote which one or more
      interfaces the server should listen on.  The default value is to
      listen on all the interfaces.  This node is also used to set a
      unicast address for the server to listen with a specific
      interface.  For example, if the server is being configured to
      listen on a unicast address assigned to a specific interface, the
      format "eth1/2001:db8::1" can be used.

   o  option-sets: DHCPv6 employs various options to carry additional
      information and parameters in DHCP messages.  This container
      defines all the possible options that need to be configured at the
      server side.  The relevant RFCs that define those options include:
      [RFC8415], [RFC3319], [RFC3646], [RFC3898], [RFC4242], [RFC4704],
      [RFC4833], [RFC5908], [RFC5970], [RFC4075], [RFC6334], [RFC6784],
      [RFC7078], [RFC7083], [RFC7291], [RFC7598].

   o  option-set: A server may allow different option sets to be
      configured for different conditions (i.e. different networks,
      clients and etc).  This "option-set" list enables various sets of
      options being defined and configured in a single server.
      Different sets are distinguished by the key called "option-set-
      id".  All the possible options discussed above are defined in the
      list and each option is corresponding to a container.  Since all
      the options in the list are optional, each container in this list
      has a 'presence' statement to indicate whether this option
      (container) will be included in the current option set or not.  In
      addition, each container also has a 'if-feature' statement to
      indicate whether the server supports this option (container).

   o  network-ranges: This model supports a hierarchy to achieve dynamic
      configuration.  That is to say we could configure the server at
      different levels through this model.  The top level is a global
      level which is defined as the container "network-ranges".  The
      following levels are defined as sub-containers under it.  The
      "network-ranges" contains the parameters (e.g. option-sets) that
      would be allocated to all the clients served by this server.

   o  network-range: Under the "network-ranges" container, a "network-
      range" list is defined to configure the server at a network level
      which is also considered as the second level.  Different network
      are identified by the key "network-range-id".  This is because a
      server may have different configuration parameters (e.g. option
      sets) for different networks.

   o  address-pools: Under the "network-range" list, a container
      describes the DHCPv6 server's address pools for a specific network
      is defined.  This container supports the server to be configured
      at a pool level.

   o  address-pool: A DHCPv6 server can be configured with several
      address pools for a specific network.  This list defines such
      address pools which are distinguish by the key called "pool-id".

   o  rapid-commit: Setting the value to 'true' represents the address/
      prefix pool support the Solicit-Reply message exchange. 'false'
      means the server will simply ignore the Rapid Commit option in
      Solicit message.

   o  client-class: If this is instantiated, the address/pd pool will
      only serve the clients belonging to this class.

   o  max-address-count: Maximum count of addresses that can be
      allocated in this pool.  This value may be less than count of
      total addresses in this pool.

   o  prefix-pools: If a server supports prefix delegation function,
      this container under the "network-range" list will be valid to
      define the delegating router's prefix pools for a specific
      network.  This container also supports the server to be configured
      at a pool level.

   o  prefix-pool: Similar to server's address pools, a delegating
      router can also be configured with multiple prefix pools specified
      by a list called "prefix-pool".

   o  max-pd-space-utilization: Maximum utilization of pd space in this
      pool.

   o  host-reservations: This container allows the server to make
      reservations at host level.

   o  host-reservation: This list allows the server to reserve
      addresses, prefixes, hostname and options for different clients.
      A server may reserve multiple addresses and prefixes for a single
      client.

   o  relay-opaque-params: This container contains some opaque values in
      Relay Agent options that need to be configured on the server side
      only for value match.  Such Relay Agent options include Interface-
      Id option, Remote-Id option and Subscriber-Id option.

   o  rsoo-enabled-options: [RFC6422] requires that the server SHOULD
      have an administrator-configurable list of RSOO-enabled options.
      This container include a list called "rsoo-enabled-option" to
      allow new RSOO-enabled options to be defined at the server side.

   o  server-state: This container includes the state data of a server.

   o  binding-info: A list records a static binding information for each
      DHCPv6 client that has already been assigned IPv6 addresses/
      prefixes that are dynamically allocated and reserved in advance.

   o  packet-stats: A container presents the packet statistics related
      to the DHCPv6 server.

   Information about notifications:

   o  address/pd-pool-running-out: raised when the address/prefix pool
      is going to run out.  A threshold for utilization ratio of the
      pool (max-address-count/max-pd-space utilization) has been defined
      in the server feature so that it will notify the administrator
      when the utilization ratio reaches the threshold, and such
      threshold is a settable parameter.

   o  invalid-client-detected: raised when the server has found a client
      which can be regarded as a potential attacker.  Some description
      could also be included.

2.2.  DHCPv6 Relay Tree Diagrams

   INSERT RELAY TREE DIAGRAM HERE

   Introduction of important nodes:

   o  relay-config: This container contains the configuration data of
      the relay.

Internet-Draft              DHCPv6 YANG Model             September 2019


   o  relay-attributes: A container describes some basic attributes of
      the relay agent including some relay agent specific options data
      that need to be configured previously.  Such options include
      Remote-Id option and Subscriber-Id option.

   o  dest-addrs: Each DHCPv6 relay agent may be configured with a list
      of destination addresses.  This node defines such a list of IPv6
      addresses that may include unicast addresses, multicast addresses
      or other addresses.

   o  rsoo-options-sets: DHCPv6 relay agent could provide some
      information that would be useful to DHCPv6 client.  Since relay
      agent cannot provide options directly to the client, [RFC6422]
      defines RSOO-enabled options to propose options for the server to
      send to the client.  This container models such RSOO-enabled
      options.

   o  option-set: This list under the "rsoo-option-sets" container is
      similar to the that defined in server module.  It allows the relay
      to implement several sets of RSOO-enabled options for different
      interfaces.  The list only include the EAP Re-authentication
      Protocol (ERP) Local Domain Name DHCPv6 Option defined in
      [RFC6440], since it is the only one RSOO-enabled options accepted
      by IANA so far.

   o  relay-if: A relay agent may have several interfaces, we should
      provide a way to configure and manage parameters on the interface-
      level.  A list that describes specific interfaces and their
      corresponding parameters is employed to fulfill the configuration.
      Here we use a string called "if-name" as the key of list.

   o  relay-state: This container contains the configuration data of the
      relay.

   o  pd-route: A sub-container of "relay-if" which describes the route
      for delegated prefixes into the provider edge router.

   o  next-entity: This node defines a list that is used to describe the
      next hop entity of this relay agent.  Different entities are
      distinguished by their addresses.

   o  packet-stats: A container shows packet state information of a
      specific data communication.

   o  relay-stats: The "relay-stats" container records and presents the
      overall packet statistics of the relay agent.

   Information about notifications:

   o  topo-changed: raised when the topology of the relay agent is
      changed.

2.3.  DHCPv6 Client Tree Diagrams

   INSERT CLIENT TREE DIAGRAM HERE


   Introduction of important nodes:

   o  client-config: This container includes the configuration data of
      the client.

   o  duid: Each server and client has only one DUID (DHCP Unique
      Identifier).  The DUID here will be carried in the Client ID
      option to identify a specific DHCPv6 client.  This leaf are same
      as the "duid" leaf in "dhcpv6-server" feature.

   o  client-if: A client may have several interfaces, it is more
      reasonable to configure and manage parameters on the interface-
      level.  The list defines a specific client interface and its data.
      Different interfaces are distinguished by the "ifName" key which
      is a configurable string value.

   o  pd-function: Whether the client can act as a requesting router to
      request prefixes using prefix delegation ([RFC3633]).

   o  rapid-commit: 'true' indicates a client can initiate a Solicit-
      Reply message exchange by adding a Rapid Commit option in Solicit
      message.  'false' means the client is not allowed to add a Rapid
      Commit option to request addresses in a two-message exchange
      pattern.

   o  client-configured-options: Similar to the server, the client also
      need to configure some options to fulfill some desired functions.
      This container include all the potential options that need to be
      configured at the client side.  The relevant RFCs that define
      those options include: [RFC8415], [RFC4704], [RFC5970], [RFC6784],
      [RFC6939].

   o  option-request-option: This container provide a way to configure
      the list of options that the client will request in its ORO
      option.

   o  client-state: This container includes the state data of the
      client.

   o  if-other-params: A client can obtain extra configuration data
      other than address and prefix information through DHCPv6 options.
      This container describes such data the client was configured
      through DHCPv6.  The potential configuration data may include DNS
      server parameters, SIP server parameters and etc.

   o  packet-stats: A container records all the packet status
      information of a specific interface.

   Information about notifications:

   o  ia-lease-event: raised when the client was allocated a new IA from
      the server or it renew/rebind/release its current IA.

   o  invalid-ia-detected: raised when the identity association of the
      client can be proved to be invalid.  Possible condition includes
      duplicated address, illegal address, etc.

   o  retransmission-failed: raised when the retransmission mechanism
      defined in [RFC8415] is failed.

   o  failed-status-turn-up: raised when the client receives a message
      includes an unsuccessful Status Code option.
